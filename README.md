# One Month Candlestick Forecasting Banking Mining Stocks in LQ45_Scientific Article

This project is part of my research work as an Undergraduate Research Assistant, focusing on developing a deep learning model to perform multi-step stock price forecasting for one month ahead in full candlestick format using an LSTM architecture.

Research Objectives
- Develop a deep learning model capable of forecasting stock prices in candlestick format (Open, High, Low, Close).
- Perform multi-step predictions for a 22-day horizon, offering a more complex and informative output compared to typical next-day or line-chart forecasting methods.

Libraries Used
- Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib)
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Scikit-learn
- Conduct model performance evaluation using error metrics such as MAE, RMSE, and MAPE.
